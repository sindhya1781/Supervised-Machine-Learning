# Supervised-Machine-Learning

This repository contains different aspects of Supervised Machine Learning algorithms implemented with/without pre-defined libraries in place as a part of my coursework.

Algorithms - 

1. Quadratic Loss Function
2. Mean Absolute Error
3. Huber Loss with different values of Delta
4. Batch Gradient Descent
5. Stochastic Gradient Descent
